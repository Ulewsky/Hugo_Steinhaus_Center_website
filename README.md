## Assignment:

Visit the “Publications” section of the Hugo Steinhaus Center website (http:
//prac.im.pwr.wroc.pl/~hugo/HSC/hsc.html). Scrape the data on research
papers from that site and generate a cooperation network of authors in the
following way:

1. members of HCS are the nodes,
2. the size of a node is proportional to the number of papers co-authored by
the node,
3. a link between two nodes means a paper written together by the corresponding members,
4. a weight of the link indicates the total number of common papers.
Visualize the network (with names and link weights). Detect the connected
components.
